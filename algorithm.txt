1. Tell the user the purpose of the program
2. Ask the user what type of ski jump it is (normal or large)
3. Ask the user their speed at the end of the ramp
4. Create an if else statement for the two hill types
5. In each if statement,
     i. Calculate the distance traveled by multiplying the jumper's speed with the time in air: sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
    ii. Calculate how many points the jumper earned using this formula: 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter
   iii. Tell the user how many points they got
    iv. If the jumper has at least 61 points,
           a. congratulate the user
        Otherwise, if their points are less than 10
           a. ask the user what happened
         Otherwise,
           a. tell the user they didn't go very far
